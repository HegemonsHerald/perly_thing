# 0. for some reason, matching against lines doesn't work anymore!
# 0.1 take out the empty line statement and check what happens then!
# 0.2 try to find out, why that might make the other wheres behave differently
# 1. in s.pl read from a file, so you got the buffer-line input
# 2. match against that
# 3. match with commas, match with \"s, match with \'s
